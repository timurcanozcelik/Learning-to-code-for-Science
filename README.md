# Learning-to-code-for-Science
This is a repository that chronicles my journey towards technical mastery of computers and making them do computer things so I can help expand our collective human knowledge. 

I am really interested in learning new things and understanding the world. But sometimes I don't know where to start, and I feel stuck. There must be a way to move forward. For now, I think I'll keep reading and learning until a path presents itself to me.
